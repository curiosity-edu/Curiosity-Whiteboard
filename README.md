This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Live Site

https://curiosity-edu.org

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Data Model

- Firestore (signed-in persistence):
  - `users/{uid}`
  - `users/{uid}/boards/{boardId}`

### User Document (`users/{uid}`)

```jsonc
{
  "uid": "...",
  "name": "...",
  "email": "...",
  "imageUrl": "...",
  "addToCanvas": false,
  "createdAt": "serverTimestamp()",
  "updatedAt": "serverTimestamp()"
}
```

### Board Document (`users/{uid}/boards/{boardId}`)

```jsonc
{
  "id": "1731520123456-abc12345",
  "title": "Algebra Practice",
  "createdAt": 1731520123456,
  "updatedAt": 1731520456789,
  "items": [
    {
      "question": "…transcribed text…",
      "response": "…AI response text…",
      "ts": 1731520123456
    }
  ],
  "doc": {
    /* TLDraw snapshot */
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `items` is a list of Q/A entries (one entry per “Ask AI”).
- `doc` is the TLDraw snapshot used to restore the canvas.
- For signed-out users, the app does not write to Firestore.

## Prompting Rules

### System Prompt

The system prompt is composed of two parts:

- The contents of `mode_detection_rules.txt` at the repository root (mode detection + response behavior).
- The existing format policy and JSON output instructions (unchanged), shown below for reference:

```
Response format policy: DO NOT use LaTeX/TeX markup or commands (no \frac, \sec, \tan, $$, \[, \], or \( \)).
Use natural language with inline math using plain text or Unicode symbols where helpful (e.g., ×, ÷, √, ⁰, ¹, ², ³, ⁴, ⁵, ⁶, ⁷, ⁸, ⁹), and function names like sec(x), tan(x).
When writing powers, use Unicode superscripts (e.g., x², x³) instead of caret notation. For fractions, use a slash (e.g., (a+b)/2) if needed. Keep the output readable as normal text.
Keep within ~120 words unless the image explicitly asks for detailed explanation.
You will be given prior conversation history as a JSON array of items {question, response}. Use it only as context; do not repeat it.
Return ONLY valid JSON with keys:
- message: <final response text>
- question_text: <your best transcription of the question from the image>
- session_title (optional): If this seems to be the first message of a new session, provide a short 2-3 word descriptive title (no quotes, title case).
```

### User Prompt (image flow)

```
Here is the prior history as JSON. Use it as context: [historyString]
Now read the math in this image and respond using the rules above.
Important: write your response as natural text with inline math, not LaTeX/TeX. No backslashes or TeX commands.
Return ONLY JSON with the keys described above.
[Image: dataUrl]

### User Prompt (voice-only flow)

```

Here is the prior history as JSON. Use it as context: [historyString]
Now answer this question: [spoken text]
Important: write your response as natural text with inline math, not LaTeX/TeX. No backslashes or TeX commands.
Return ONLY JSON with the keys described above.

```

```

## Program Flow

### 0. Landing and Navigation

- User lands at `GET /`:
  - Signed-in:
    - Query `users/{uid}/boards` ordered by `updatedAt desc`.
    - Redirect to the most recently updated board.
    - If no boards exist, create an `Untitled Board` in Firestore and open it.
  - Signed-out:
    - Redirect to a fresh local board id (local-only).
- Navigation is minimal. The app surfaces an "About Us" link (icon-only in the collapsed sidebar; text + icon in the expanded sidebar).
- Authentication controls live in the left sidebar footer, not in a top header. In collapsed mode, a round avatar/sign‑in button appears at the bottom.
- The My Boards history lives as a collapsible left sidebar on the board view.
- The `/boards` route is not used as a dedicated boards page.

### 1. Board View (`/board/[id]`)

- Renders `Board` with a required `boardId` prop.
- Left sidebar (signed-in users): `MyBoardsSidebar` lists boards from Firestore (`users/{uid}/boards`), supports rename/delete, and navigation.
- Center: TLDraw canvas fills available height; bottom toolbar always visible.
- Right: AI Panel with controls (Ask AI, Add to Canvas, History). Collapsible and persisted in `localStorage`.
- Signed-in board persistence:
  - On mount, load `doc` and `items` from Firestore.
  - TLDraw local persistence is disabled for signed-in users so Firestore is the single source of truth.
  - Autosave TLDraw snapshot (`doc`) to Firestore (debounced).
  - Persist Q/A history (`items`) to Firestore.

### 2. Ask AI (client in `src/components/Board.tsx`)

- Collects selected shapes (or all shapes if none) and exports as PNG (with padding, scale).
- Constructs `FormData` with `image` (when shapes exist) and `boardId`.
- Includes `history` (stringified Q/A items) so the model has context.
- `POST /api/solve` is called; loading state is shown.

### 2b. Voice Input Flow (client in `src/components/Board.tsx`)

- **Start/Stop**: The AI Panel has a `🎤 Speak / ⏹️ Stop` button.
- **Engine**: Uses the browser Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition` / `webkitSpeechRecognition`). No external library.
- **Continuous listening**: `continuous = true` with an internal `keepListening` flag. On `onend`, if `keepListening` is true, recognition auto-restarts. User presses Stop to end.
- **Results handling**: Interim and final transcripts are accumulated. On session end/restart, the spoken text is:
  - Not added to the canvas.
  - Passed to `askAI(spoken)` so the existing canvas snapshot (if any) is paired with the question.
  - If the board has no shapes, a text-only request is sent (no image) and the server handles it.

### 3. Solve API (server in `src/app/api/solve/route.ts`)

- Accepts `image` (PNG) and/or `question` (text from voice). At least one must be present.
- Receives optional prior history from the client (as JSON string) for context.
- For image requests: sends the image + history to the model.
- For voice-only requests: sends the text question + history to the model (no image).
- Returns JSON `{ message, questionText, boardId, ... }`.

Note: persistence of Q/A history happens client-side (Firestore when signed in).

### 4. Authentication

- **Provider/Context**: `src/context/AuthContext.js` (Client Component) exposes `[user, googleSignIn, logOut]` using Firebase Auth.
- **UI Location**: Authentication controls are rendered in the left sidebar footer (not a top nav bar). In collapsed mode, a compact avatar/sign-in button appears at the bottom.
- **Navigation**: The app uses minimal navigation. An "About Us" link is available via the sidebar (icon-only when collapsed; icon + text when expanded).
- **Firebase config**: `src/lib/firebase.ts` initializes app/auth/storage/firestore. Analytics is guarded with `typeof window !== "undefined"` to avoid SSR errors.

### 5. Client Update (Board)

- Shows the AI response in the AI Panel list (newest first).
- If "Add to Canvas" is enabled, adds a TLDraw text shape below the selection with `toRichText(message)`.
- History overlay can be opened to view the entire board conversation; reads `GET /api/boards/[id]`.

### 6. Persistence

- Signed-in persistence:
  - Firestore user document: `users/{uid}`
  - Firestore boards: `users/{uid}/boards/{boardId}`
  - TLDraw local persistence disabled; Firestore is authoritative.
- Signed-out:
  - No Firestore writes.
  - TLDraw uses client persistence for the anonymous session.

### 7. Error Handling

- Network errors: Shows user-friendly error message in the AI panel
- API errors: Displays the error message from the server
- Invalid responses: Falls back to plain text display if JSON parsing fails
- Rate limiting: Implements exponential backoff for retries

## Styling & UX Notes

- **Global layout**: The root layout pins the app to the viewport (fixed `main` covering the screen). Scrolling happens inside panels.
- **My Boards Sidebar**: Collapsible left sidebar (persists in `localStorage` under `boardsOpen`).
  - Collapse/expand uses `TbLayoutSidebarLeftCollapseFilled`.
  - "About Us" uses `FcAbout`.
  - "New Board" uses `IoIosCreate`.
  - Hover over a board to reveal delete; confirmation precedes `DELETE /api/boards/[id]`.
- **Canvas/Layout**: TLDraw canvas fills available space via `absolute inset-0` within a `min-h-0` flex container.
- **AI Panel**: Collapsible right panel with Ask AI, Settings (Add to Canvas, History), and Voice controls.
  - Collapse uses `TbLayoutSidebarRightCollapseFilled`.
  - Settings button uses `IoIosSettings`.
  - Toggle persists in `localStorage` under `aiOpen`. History is an in-panel overlay.
- **About page**: Scrollable within the fixed layout by using a viewport-height container (`h-screen`) with `overflow-y: auto`; content is a centered readable column.

## Source Files Overview

- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Global layout with a fixed main viewport and white background scaffolding; content panes scroll internally.
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Signed-in redirect to most recent Firestore board (or auto-create `Untitled Board`), signed-out redirects to a fresh local board.
- `src/context/AuthContext.js` — Client auth context exposing `[user, googleSignIn, logOut]`.
- `src/components/AuthControls.tsx` — Sign-in/sign-out controls (routes to `/` after auth changes).
- `src/app/boards/new/page.tsx` — Creates a new Firestore board (signed-in) and navigates to `/board/[id]`.
- `src/app/boards/page.tsx` — Not a boards index page (currently `notFound()`).
- `src/components/MyBoardsSidebar.tsx` — Client sidebar listing boards, hover-delete with confirmation, navigation, and open-state persistence.
- `src/app/board/[id]/page.tsx` — Server page that renders `<Board boardId={id} />`.
- `src/components/Board.tsx` — Client TLDraw board + AI Panel. Calls `/api/solve`, shows responses, and persists board state/history to Firestore when signed in.
- `src/app/api/solve/route.ts` — Accepts `image` (+ optional `history`) and calls OpenAI. Stateless (no server-side persistence).
- `src/app/api/boards/*` — Legacy JSON-based board endpoints (no longer used for signed-in persistence).
- `src/app/api/history/route.ts` — Legacy sessions endpoint.
- `src/app/globals.css` — Tailwind setup and theme tokens. Forces light background to avoid dark strips; sets body text color.
- `src/lib/firebase.ts` — Centralized Firebase initialization and exports (auth, storage, firestore, analytics guarded for SSR).
- `public/textred.png` — Logo used in the left sidebar and About page.
- `public/Asset 7.svg` — Sidebar icon used for the collapsed sidebar button.
